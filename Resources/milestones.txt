1. Add the UI elements to the react app. This includes a table, the text input, and the two buttons.
2. Add a new handler on the server. It responds with the list of string (initialize the list to have a few elements).
3. In the UI, add an onload effect that queries for the list of string and populates a state variable.  The table should now render dynamically based on the list from the server.
4. Implement the handler for the "Refresh" button.
5. Add a new handler on the server. It takes the input and appends the string to the list.
6. Implement the handler for the "Add" button.  Refresh the list on add as well.
7. Add a new handler on the server. It takes the input for what item in the list to delete and deletes that item.
8. Implement the handler for the [x] button. Refresh the list on delete as well.
